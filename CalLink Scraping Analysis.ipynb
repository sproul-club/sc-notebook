Additionally,&nbsp;we will participate in outreach programs within the Berkeley community at least twice during the&nbsp;academic year.

ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters.

As a team, we create and implement a variety of projects that help establish sustainable practices and promote environmental awareness on campus. Project committees within STeam work as a tight unit to accomplish their goals, and leadership capacity is shared equally. STeam is a commission of the ASUC. STeam members meet all together twice a month and separately within project groups every week to update each other on the progress of our projects and brainstorm strategies for successful implementation. Project groups to work on their individual projects. The team also spends time outside of meetings through our STeam Socials and Community Service days a few times per semester.</p>\\r\\n<p>In Fall 2006 STeam partnered with SUPERB to host a Climate Change Fair which featured a screening of Al Gore's \\\"An Inconvenient Truth,\\\" as well as many campus and community environmental organizations.&nbsp;STeam has coordinated EarthWeek since 2006 to celebrate Earth Day and engage the campus community in solutions to environmental issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since our founding, Sustainability Team has provided students with reduced free or cost reusable water bottles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, other toxic pollutants and waste--especially popular are our reduced priced Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottles!</p>\\r\\n<p>In Spring 2007 STeam launched The Local, UC Berkeley's first-ever student-run, nonprofit, cooperative produce stand that sells only locally grown, pesticide free, fresh fruits and vegetables. They're especially affordable since the stand is run completely by volunteers!</p>\\r\\n<p>In Fall 2007 and Spring 2008, STeam continued its work with Earthweek and is started two new projects including our Responsible Investments Campaign (RI)and our One-Side-Clean Paper Project (OSC). RI retired at the end of Spring 2009, but OSC is still extremely vibrant and productive.</p>\\r\\n<p>The 2009-2010 academic school year also saw the advent of the Composting Group, Student Team on Zero Waste and Plastics, and Campus Collaboration.&nbsp; Campus Collaboration got absorbed into another entity outside of STeam [B-GAIA/ECO] during Fall 2010.</p>\\r\\n<p>The highlights of the 2010-2011 academic year include the successful screening of \\\"Tapped\\\", a movie about the negative externalities associated with bottled water, the creation of our very own bag monster, and the creation of an auditing team for the ASUC's Green Certification pilot program, in which student groups can be actively recognized for their \\\"greening\\\" efforts.</p>\\r\\n<p>During the 2011-2012 academic year, STeam had eight project groups: The Local, One Side Clean, Earth Week, Focus the Nation (STeam Energy), End Coal Campaign, Fair Trade University, Student Team on Zero Waste and Plastic (STOP), and Compost Group. Each project group worked hard to create tangible improvements and spread awareness on campus. Highlights include the screening of two documentaries: <em>The Last Mountain</em> and&nbsp;<em>Waste Land</em>, attending both the Fall and Spring California Student Sustainability Coalition Convergences, bonding at a STeam Winter Retreat, organizing a fantastic Earth Week 2012, and creating the Guide to Sustainability at Cal video for the CalSO program.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the 2012-2013 academic year, the new EcoMovie Nights program continued to grow while many of our members became more involved in the&nbsp;California Student Sustainability Coalition's biannual convergences. STeam hosted its last Earth Week in April 2013, and at the end of the year, The Local was given to the Berkeley Student Food Collective to manage. The spring semester was fueled with new energy as the Fossil Free Cal campaign was kicking off, starting off as the Cal Students for Sustiainable Investment project.</p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In the 2013-2014 academic year, STeam organize two retreats to the Marin Headlands and Santa Cruz, we made a educational environmental video which was shown to all new students during the upcoming CalSO, had a solar town hall to bring attention to the lack of renewable energy on campus and developed the Refills Not Landfills initiative with CRRS to reduce the cost of reusable water bottles and to incentivise using them in cafes around campus.</span></p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In the 2014-2015 academic year, STeam started its 5th project group, FLOW, in response to the growing drought in California. ECO movie became integrated into SERC to carry out the role of screening environmental films to the campus. STeam went on two fantastic retreats to the same locations as last year, received two large grants to retrofit and replace toilets in the Cloyne Cooperative and change the waste Infrastructure in Evans hall by implementing dyson hand dryers. STeam Leadership helped create and reboot the Environmental Coalition (ECO) to bring together the 40+ environmental groups to work collectively on environmental and political issues on campus, STeam Energy also authored and organized the ASUC Solar Referendum campaign, which sought to codify student support for on and off campus solar energy, which passed by 89% (9,168 votes)in the 2015 ASUC elections.</span></p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In the 2015-2016 academic year, STeam had 6 project groups. STeam Energy Group, One Side Clean (OSC), FLOW, Fossil Free at Cal, Students Towards Zero Plastic (STOP) and our newest project group, I Will RIde - The official branch of the High Speed Train Authority on campus, which worked on transportation issues in the bay area. After years of hard work. Fossil Free at Cal helped pressure the UC regents to divest $200 million from coal and tar sands investments, STeam organized a very successful talk by waste activist Beth Terry about how to live plastic free.

It has become something of an icon in the area, and has served countless thousands in a variety of ways during its 45-year history. Its founding principles and structures survive to this day:</p>\\r\\n<h2>Health care is a basic human right and should not be linked to profit.</h2>\\r\\n<p>Fees have never been charged for any services, medications, or supplies provided at the Berkeley Free Clinic. The Clinic relies solely on individual or organizational donations and government support. We are one of the only clinics in California offering primary health care free of charge. We maintain that health care should be available at a level and quality sufficient to meet the basic needs of everyone regardless of race, gender, age, immigration status, income level, or any other characteristic. Our philosophy is that health care is a right, not a privilege. We are strongly opposed to health care delivery as a profit-making industry.</p>\\r\\n<h2>A great deal of health care knowledge can and should be available and accessible to individuals such that they can have the power to recognize and respond to their own health issues.</h2>\\r\\n<p>All services at the BFC emphasize education, self-knowledge, and increasing awareness and access to appropriate resources. Whenever possible, our goal is to demystify health care and other human services, both for the volunteer members of the Clinic and for clients. We believe that individuals and communities should be educated and empowered with regard to their health care. In practice, this means that we emphasize education and offer referrals to help meet any needs that are outside the scope of our services. We attempt to include our clients in their own care by inviting their input and observations, and by fully describing possible solutions to their concerns.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Health care should be broadly defined and considerate of the whole being and environment, not simply a response to isolated symptoms.</h2>\\r\\n<p>We view health as encompassing the total well-being of a person including physical, emotional, and environmental needs. In all our services, we strive to relate to clients as human beings, each with unique circumstances, resources and needs. Our health care providers involve clients as thoroughly as possible in the health care process in order to best educate and develop appropriate plans for each individual. One of our major concerns has been the balance of control in the provider-client interaction. Much of our struggle has been to develop alternatives to the tendency in the human-service industry to require that the client give control of the management of her physical and mental health into the hands of \\\"experts\\\" taken on faith. Confidentiality is another major sub-issue within that broader issue of control. Our volunteer-controlled collective has voted to sacrifice many hundreds of thousands of dollars in available government funding opportunities which would have required that our clients' identity and personal histories --including whatever labels have been assigned to them by professionals-- be shared with government funding sources and other programs.</p>\\r\\n<h2>In keeping with the goals of individual empowerment and the building of healthy communities, locally-based organizations should enable worker participation and responsibility.</h2>\\r\\n<p>The BFC has operated as a worker&rsquo;s collective since its inception. Every volunteer has membership in the collective, and has the right to a voice and a vote in all decision-making processes that affect both their specific service area as well as the entire Clinic. Many of these Clinic volunteers move on to further their knowledge and contribution in the area of health in a variety of capacities throughout the local area, the country, and the world.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div id=\\\"x_x_x_page-body-footer\\\" class=\\\"x_x_x_extra-wrapper\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div id=\\\"x_x_x_sidebar-one-wrapper\\\" class=\\\"x_x_x_vertical-navigation-bar-wrapper\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div id=\\\"x_x_x_body-clearer\\\" class=\\\"x_x_x_clearer\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div id=\\\"x_x_x_page-footer-wrapper\\\">&nbsp;</div>\", \"email\": \"aharmon@berkeley.edu\", \"phone\": \"510-548-2570\", \"phone-ext\": null, \"social-media\": {\"website\": \"http://www.berkeleyfreeclinic.org/\", \"flickr\": null, \"google-calendar\": null, \"google-plus\": null, \"instagram\": null, \"linkedin\": null, \"pinterest\": null, \"tumblr\": null, \"vimeo\": null, \"youtube\": null, \"facebook\": \"https://www.facebook.com/The-Berkeley-Free-Clinic-114556755233442/\", \"twitter-url\": null, \"twitter-user\": null}}, {\"id\": \"friendsofthecoop\", \"name\": \"Friends of the Co-ops\", \"has-profile-pic\": true, \"has-cover-pic\": true, \"start-date\": null, \"summary\": \"We are an organization open to all students, faculty, and staff interested in the Berkeley Student Housing Co-ops.

This class is built for students who do not have any prior experience or knowledge of these programs.&nbsp;We work with students in developing a thorough understanding of these programs with weekly lessons and hands-on tutorials. In addition, students complete relevant homework exercises which aim to give students the opportunity to practice tools, develop original designs, and channel their creativity. Lastly, we explore graphic design trends, principles, and applications.</li>\\r\\n<li><em>Graphic Design Principles</em><br />This is a technical course in which students are taught extensive knowledge of Adobe programs (such as Illustrator and/or Photoshop). The class also covers conceptual and theoretical aspects of design such as color theory, branding, and user interface design.&nbsp;At the end of the course, students have a portfolio of work showcasing extensive knowledge on several design topics and an understanding of various elements of design.</li>\\r\\n<li><em>Photography Principles</em><br />This DeCal is for students interested in learning photography. We start off with the basics (camera manipulations and shooting in RAW) and quickly move onto composition rules and tricks to get better, more thought out photos, and from there move onto how to be a professional photographer, photo ethics, and integrating art into photography.

The Beta Xi chapter of Kappa Sigma is looking to Charter this Fall 2019 Semester. We currently have a group of 40 guys consisting of many different years and majors. Many of our brothers are interested in a variety of activities such as weight lifting, barbecuing, sports, climbing, and hiking and a few are involved in Cal sports such as baseball and rowing.<br /><br />As we are a new fraternity, we are looking to start new traditions and events here at Cal and we want to branch out into all aspects of student life such as philanthropy, sports, and academics. We want to contend in competitive intramural teams like soccer, football, and basketball. We also have a full year of fun brotherhood events like retreats, road trips, barbecues, and date parties!<br /><br />If you are interested in meeting the brothers and becoming a part of an amazing community then come on out to our Rush events, meet the brothers and learn about what it means to be a brother of Kappa Sigma.

The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campu<span class=\\\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\\\">s of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.<br /><br />The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.<br /><br />On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.<br /><br />Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.<br /><br />Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.</span></p>\", \"email\": null, \"phone\": null, \"phone-ext\": null, \"social-media\": {\"website\": \"http://www.lambda1975.org/\", \"flickr\": null, \"google-calendar\": null, \"google-plus\": null, \"instagram\": null, \"linkedin\": null, \"pinterest\": null, \"tumblr\": null, \"vimeo\": null, \"youtube\": null, \"facebook\": \"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BX-Lambdas-Lambda-Theta-Phi-Latin-Fraternity-Inc/147060575317434\", \"twitter-url\": null, \"twitter-user\": null}}, {\"id\": \"lul\", \"name\": \"Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc.\", \"has-profile-pic\": true, \"has-cover-pic\": true, \"start-date\": \"2011-11-30\", \"summary\": \"La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Incorporated primarily seeks to take a leadership role in meeting the needs of the Latino community through academic achievement, cultural awareness, community service & promotion of the Latino culture\", \"categories\": [\"CalGreeks Multicultural Greek Council (MCGC) Fraternities & Sororities\"], \"short-name\": \"LUL\", \"description\": \"<p>Established with ASUC 11/9/11 SB 138 Fall 2011</p>\", \"email\": null, \"phone\": null, \"phone-ext\": null, \"social-media\": {\"website\": null, \"flickr\": null, \"google-calendar\": null, \"google-plus\": null, \"instagram\": null, \"linkedin\": null, \"pinterest\": null, \"tumblr\": null, \"vimeo\": null, \"youtube\": null, \"facebook\": null, \"twitter-url\": null, \"twitter-user\": null}}, {\"id\": \"lasr\", \"name\": \"Laotian American Student Representatives\", \"has-profile-pic\": true, \"has-cover-pic\": true, \"start-date\": null, \"summary\": \"The primary goal of LASR is to create a community  for UC Berkeley students who originated from Laos and to establish awareness for those who are interested in the cultures and  experiences of Laotians.\", \"categories\": [\"y ASUC Student Activity Groups\", \"Undergraduate Organizations\", \"Cultural & Identity/Cultural & Ethnic\"], \"short-name\": \"LASR\", \"description\": \"<p>The primary goal of LASR is to create a community for UC Berkeley students who originated from Laos and to establish awareness for those who are interested in the cultures and experiences of Laotians.

They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence&hellip;without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the &ldquo;inclusive we&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;exclusive we&rdquo;.</p>\\r\\n<p>From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;Culture For Service and Service For Humanity.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n<p>The fraternity exceeded the prevailing models of Black Greek-Letter fraternal organizations by being the first to establish alumni chapters, to establish youth mentoring clubs, to establish a federal credit union, to establish chapters in Africa, and establish a collegiate chapter outside of the United States, and is the only fraternity to hold a constitutional bond with a predominantly African-American sorority, Zeta Phi Beta (&Zeta;&Phi;&Beta;), which was founded on January 16, 1920, at Howard University in Washington, D.C., through the efforts of members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>The Nasty Delta Beta Chapter was chartered at Cal State Hayward, now East Bay as the FIRST Greek Letter Organization, on the campus, on June 28, 1965 by 5 Sigma Men with the help of Bro.

It flourished, and gradually extended to other colleges and universities throughout the country.

Reporting sexual harassment/assault in these variable environments, let alone bringing justice to perpetrators after the incident, is inherently difficult. While the survivor&rsquo;s home institution may have protocols for handling such incidents, the perpetrator can frequently be from a different institution and therefore removed from penalty enforcement.

She asked a few Southeast Asian UC Berkeley students in her class and some she knew to help get involved with the conference. Their role was to head up the youth portion of the co<span class=\\\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\\\">nference. Using data information collected the conference Professor Um along with the UC Berkeley students developed the booklet that SASC has called A Dream Denied about Southeast Asians and their struggle to gain access to higher education.</span></p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\\\"><br />After the conference, the youth summit organizers, consisting of members from the Laotian, Hmong, Cambodian, and Vietnamese student groups felt connected and saw a need for a space/coalition to address issues across the community. They recognized that there were distinct groups that already existed to promote cultural awareness and knew that that was not one of their primary goals. They were also aware that they wanted the group to be more than just a student organization, but a coalition between the Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian students coming together on common issues to strengthen the community as a whole, hence the name Southeast Asian Student Coalition. The name was created by the students as they sat at Sproul Fountain. Their goals at the time included greater promotion of higher education, community building between the different groups, outreaching to the larger community.<br /><br />At the time they believed that there was a niche that needed to be filled &ndash; an organization that would work with the different cultural groups as well as the recruitment and retention center to address the SEA community in particular. Their goal was to both build coalition as well as empowerment, and to step beyond the needs at Berkeley to incorporate the communities we came from. They went around the East Bay community asking and understanding what it is exactly that they can do. After all of that, in 2002 SASC Summer Institute was born. They wanted something where they can effectively outreach, teach, and learn to/from young people.<br /><br />Since then SASC has grown into a larger community and has expanded its reaches into the community. SASC&rsquo;s current programs include SEA Grad, SEAMentorship, SEA Prison Outreach Project, and Anthology.<br /><br />In 2005, a group of SASC folks had multiple meetings about the rebuilding of SASC, due to issues of sustainability and finding leaders in the community. From these meetings SASCommunity, a non-hierarchical committee, was created. SASComm strives to create a community of committees hoping to explore SASC&rsquo;s mission statement in different and multiple dimensions. The Round-Table structure for SASCommunity is set up to create a cohesive unit and non-hierarchical organizing system.</span></p>\", \"email\": \"UCB.SASC@gmail.com\", \"phone\": null, \"phone-ext\": null, \"social-media\": {\"website\": \"https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sasc/\", \"flickr\": null, \"google-calendar\": null, \"google-plus\": null, \"instagram\": \"https://www.instagram.com/ucbsasc/\", \"linkedin\": null, \"pinterest\": null, \"tumblr\": null, \"vimeo\": null, \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQUvrn7Q8Ygsq9_XATVttSg\", \"facebook\": \"https://www.facebook.com/ucbsasc\", \"twitter-url\": null, \"twitter-user\": null}}, {\"id\": \"seberkeley\", \"name\": \"Space Enterprise at Berkeley\", \"has-profile-pic\": true, \"has-cover-pic\": true, \"start-date\": \"2016-10-11\", \"summary\": \"Co-founded in October 2016, Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) is a student-run liquid-fuel rocket team dedicated to achieving spaceflight and developing rocket technologies at University of California, Berkeley.\", \"categories\": [\"Technology Student Organizations\", \"Undergraduate Organizations\"], \"short-name\": \"SEB\", \"description\": \"<p class=\\\"\\\">Co-founded in October 2016, Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) is a student run liquid-fuel rocket team dedicated to achieving spaceflight and developing rocket technologies at University of California, Berkeley.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"\\\">Despite being relatively young, SEB is one of the most ambitious college rocket teams in the world working towards achieving spaceflight with a liquid-fueled rocket.

To that end, we facilitate and engage in intellectual discussion on relevant issues, challenging widely held relativist assumptions on the dignity of human life, the role of individual autonomy, and society's role in protecting human life.</p>\\r\\n<p>We seek to engage both the minds and hearts of UC Berkeley's student population as well as those of our surrounding communities in addressing these issues. We desire to change the prevailing mindset in today's society so that it might be more receptive to a culture of life that fully recognizes the dignity of every human being.</p>\\r\\n<p>Furthermore, we aim to form leaders that will encourage the development of a more just society grounded in the recognition of the inherent and transcendent value of human life. We seek to enter our respective professions armed with the knowledge and tools needed to uphold the dignity of life in every facet of society.</p>\\r\\n<p>Also at the heart of BSL&rsquo;s mission is its commitment to community service. We believe that socioeconomic circumstances do not justify the taking of human life, and we affirm that such difficulties can be overcome. To that end, BSL provides information to assist women facing crisis pregnancies and refers them to local crisis pregnancy centers that provide women with what they need to bring new life into the world. We also volunteer at local crisis pregnancy centers to help promote their mission to encourage the&nbsp;cherishing and welcoming of&nbsp;new life into our community.</p>\\r\\n<p>Though the focus of our outreach is primarily local, we collaborate with other pro-life organizations from across our state and nation and are united to them by virtue of our common cause. As a member of Students for Life of America (SFLA), BSL engages in the fight for life at the state and national level. As an organization that concerns itself with matters of great public relevance, BSL strives to do everything in its capacity to shape public opinion on relevant university, state, and federal policies, as well as to influence said policies, so that these might more accurately reflect our vision for a world in which every human life is valued and protected.</p>\", \"email\": \"berkeley4life@gmail.com\", \"phone\": null, \"phone-ext\": null, \"social-media\": {\"website\": \"http://berkeley4life.org\", \"flickr\": null, \"google-calendar\": null, \"google-plus\": null, \"instagram\": null, \"linkedin\": null, \"pinterest\": null, \"tumblr\": null, \"vimeo\": null, \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGxq3s2uO8e4ALRx6fuWjCQ\", \"facebook\": \"https://www.facebook.com/BerkeleySFL\", \"twitter-url\": null, \"twitter-user\": \"berkeleyforlife\"}}, {\"id\": \"stride\", \"name\": \"Students for Racial justice, Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity\", \"has-profile-pic\": false, \"has-cover-pic\": true, \"start-date\": \"2015-09-16\", \"summary\": \"Providing a space for Joint Medical Program students and other allies to discuss matters and implement actions related to racial justice, inclusion, diversity, and equity.\", \"categories\": [\"GSG - Graduate Student Groups\", \"Political & Advocacy Student Organizations\", \"New Organization Established 2015-2016\"], \"short-name\": \"STRIDE\", \"description\": \"<ul>\\r\\n<li>To provide a space for Joint Medical Program students and other allies to discuss matters related to racial justice, inclusion, diversity, and equity.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n"

Nearly every graduate student and postdoc will have to navigate a number of challenges that are unique to academic science: having papers rejected, being scooped by a competing lab, dealing with funding, handling disagreements about authorship, etc. There is a prevailing culture in science that, as scientists, we should be expected to ignore any feelings that arise as we confront these adversities.

Four hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B infection, which tragically can lead to liver cancer early in adult life. It is the 10th leading etiologic cause of death in the world. Fortunately, the spread of the hepatitis B virus is preventable with a simple, safe, and effective vaccine.</p>\\r\\n<p>Due to an increase in demand for interpretation services, we have been expanding to provide interpretation and volunteering services for a broader range of issues beyond hepatitis B.
